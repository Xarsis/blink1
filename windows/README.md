Windows and .NET Software for blink(1)
=============================

The most recented [.NET library for blink(1)](https://github.com/SleddogSoftwareDevelopment/blink1) is [Sleddog.Blink1](https://github.com/SleddogSoftwareDevelopment/blink1) available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sleddog.Blink1) or [Github](https://github.com/SleddogSoftwareDevelopment/blink1)

The "ManagedBlink1" 100% .NET library still works, and has its own repo:

In addition to the cross-platform "blink1-tool" available in the blink1/commandline directory,
this directory contains additional Windows-related blink(1) items.
